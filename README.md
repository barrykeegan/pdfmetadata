# pdfmetadata
Python project to extract all metadata from PDF file

## Note
The jupyter notebook contains imports for pdf manipulation utilities that you may not have access to. Large sections of the code will not work if you don't have access to these utilities.

The basic code to pull out the pdf objects does not depend on any libraries that need to be pip installed and should just work.
